REST for the implementation of the basic functionalities of the online store. Product data
and orders should be stored in the database with the use of mechanisms
Java Persistence API. The application allows you to add new products (POST type request),
retrieving information about all products (GET-type request) and updating data
of a product, e.g. a change in the number of pieces available (PUT request). The application should accept
and return data in JSON format.
